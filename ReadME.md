_Hugo_:
Just include a comment with your name on top of whatever files are in the 
package you're working on. Also, I think we should all be welcome to edit each 
other's packages if we see bugs. It helps a lot to get more eyes on your source 
than just yours. And on that note, please keep your code readable :)

Also, anybody who knows markdown is welcome to convert this file to markdown.
To me it doesn't make that much of a difference.

_Lukas_:
Please comment the code, that way everybody could understand what's going on. Also, please don't do three lines of code in one line (you know what I mean) ;)
